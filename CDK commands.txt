AWS CDK Toolkit (cdk command)
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html


Project Directory:
* lib/cdk-stack.ts is where our CDK application’s main stack is defined.
* bin/cdk.ts is the entrypoint of the CDK application. It will load the stack defined in lib/cdk-stack.ts.
* package.json is our npm module manifest.
* cdk.json tells the toolkit how to run our app.
* tsconfig.json our project’s typescript configuration.
* .gitignore and .npmignore tell git and npm which files to include/exclude from source control and when publishing this module to the package manager.
* node_modules is maintained by npm and includes all our project’s dependencies.


# The first time we deploy an AWS CDK app into an environment (account/region), we need to install a “bootstrap stack”.
# This stack includes resources that are used in the toolkit’s operation.
cdk bootstrap


# create a new TypeScript CDK project
cdk init sample-app --language typescript


# synthesize a template from our app -> create an AWS CloudFormation template for each stack defined in our application.
cdk synth


# deploy a CDK app.
cdk deploy

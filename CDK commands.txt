* package.json is our npm module manifest.
* cdk.json tells the toolkit how to run our app.
* tsconfig.json our project’s typescript configuration.
* .gitignore and .npmignore tell git and npm which files to include/exclude from source control and when publishing this module to the package manager.
* node_modules is maintained by npm and includes all our project’s dependencies.
